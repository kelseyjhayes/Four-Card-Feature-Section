## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great exercise for putting my knowledge of CSS Grids to use, and using Grids in combination with Flexbox to acheive a desired look. 

I was really focused on creating pleasant designs across screen sizes, including those lower than 375px. I accomplished this by using the clamp function to create responsive padding and box sizes even as screen sizes get narrower. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving my knowledge of CSS Grids, so I can create more complex layouts. I would also like to learn how to make the transitions between grid layouts smoother across screen sizes.
